<div ng-controller="AboutCtrl"> <md-content style="background: transparent"> <div img src="images/logoSemiTrans.png" style="padding: 40px"> What is St. Augustine’s? A casual spot on The Drive with 60+ taps — many from locally sourced microbreweries (would you expect any less from a place named after the patron saint of beer?). Since our inception, we've built relationships with the leaders in the microbrew industry and we offer some of the best beers made in North America. Every beer we pour is made with top notch ingredients and created by small companies with the highest standards of quality. We keep a few faves on tap and rotate the others with what's in season. Whether you just like a cold beer after work or you fancy yourself a beer connoisseur, give our taps a try and you'll never go back to the boring stuff again. Thirsty yet? We cheer for the Canucks (no matter how many times they break our heart); and we’ve got a full patio, a lounge, and a gastropub menu of classics and new faves. </div> </md-content> </div>
